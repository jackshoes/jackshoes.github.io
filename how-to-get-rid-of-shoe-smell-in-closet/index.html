How to Get Rid of the Musty Smell in a Clothes Closet From pinterest.com
It’s possible to remove mold from clothes and shoes by washing with vinegar instead of detergent to remove the smell or by brushing mold away outside before washing with detergent in hot water and drying in the sun. The last thing you want is to replace your shoe funk with mildew odor. Run a dehumidifier or air conditioner in the room during humid weather while the closet door is open to help keep excess moisture and potential odors out of the closet. Change the bowls frequently until they absorb the scent completely and the smell gets off from the closet.
