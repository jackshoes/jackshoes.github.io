The good news is that all of the hiking shoes on my list are lightweight and will serve you well whether you’re trekking or in town. The ax3’s are very light weight at less than 10 ounces per shoe, making them a good choice for men’s lightweight hiking shoes. With its rugged design, it turns out to be the best pair for your hiking and trekking needs. The steep rs 6,000 for the shoe is something that bothers me, but its performance on rough terrain, water and snow is as good as any mountain shoe that i have worn.
