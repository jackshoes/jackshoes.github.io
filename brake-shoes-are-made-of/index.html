Brake shoes utilize a variety of organic and metallic materials to form friction material. Look around the wheels next time while you. Though considered the best material to build all sorts of brake pads and shoes, asbestos was discontinued when it came to be known that it causes cancer. They are made up of a curved piece of metal with friction material on the outside curve;
