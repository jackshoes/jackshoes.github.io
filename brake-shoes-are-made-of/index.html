Brake shoes utilize a variety of organic and metallic materials to form friction material. Look around the wheels next time while you. Though considered the best material to build all sorts of brake pads and shoes, asbestos was discontinued when it came to be known that it causes cancer.

<p>The brake shoes come in contact with inner surface of this drum to apply brakes. Brake shoes are to drum brakes what pads are to disc brakes. Instead of asbestos, brake shoes and pads were made using synthetic materials and metal powder as friction. There are holes and slots on this brake shoe for return spring, hold down hardware and self adjusting components.</p>
