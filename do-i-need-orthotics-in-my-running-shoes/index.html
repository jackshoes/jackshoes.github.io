The best thing to do is to bring your orthotic to a running shoe store and try several shoes. Fortunately, the brooks dyad 8 is a neutral running shoe that accommodates orthotics quite well.

If there is a mechanical instability involving the forefoot or an angular instability of the leg, an orthotic in the cycling shoes would be helpful.
