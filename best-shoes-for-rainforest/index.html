<p>Hiking is the name of the game in the rainforest. Unless you have weak ankles, i would be hesitant to invest in serious hiking shoes as the mud &amp; humidity in the osa wreck havoc on most shoes. This is a bit of an odd topic post, but i thought i would give it a try and see if anyone might have some advice on the topic. When choosing hiking shoes for backpacking or longer treks, look for a little extra room and a wide toe box (all keen hiking boots and shoes feature a secure heel fit with room for your toes).</p>
