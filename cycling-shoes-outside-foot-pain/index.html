Foot pain on the bike From britishcycling.org.uk
The pain results when nerves are squeezed between the heads of each foot’s five long metatarsal bones. The rigid reinforced soles transfer power more efficiently, prevent potentially fatiguing and injury causing repetitive flexing of the feet and reduce and disperse pressure on the feet from the pedal platforms. The result is a burning sensation in the ball of the foot and tingling or numb toes. There are a number of reasons that you may find yourself in pain.
