<p>The average runner will spend about 66 hours in running to accumulate 500 miles on a pair of shoes (8 minute per mile pace times 500 miles). If you own more than one pair and you're rotating your shoes, you'll get more life out of them than if you only had one pair (it's also better for you). However, if your running shoes are not showing any of the above signs of excessive wear, you may be able to wear them for longer without increasing the risk of injury. Replacing the soles of your shoes is also an opportunity to change the look of the shoe.</p>
