How to Get Creases Out of Leather Shoes Safe Work Gears From safeworkgears.com
A large pair of leather shoes creates a lot of excess room. Steam and heat can help to loosen these stubborn creases but they aren’t as efficient as using a blow dryer directly on your footwear.

A hairdryer is usually found at home and could help you with the unwanted creases on your leather shoes.
