The brake shoes have bake linings on their outer surfaces. Hold the lining on the shoe, but i found that a brake drum of the right size works great. This arrangement is suitable for application where lining stability is important and a servo assisted booster is able to compensate for the low resultant drag force relative to a given input shoe tip force. 4.maintenance and repairs of disc brakes is easy.

<p>The primary shoe tends to rotate with the brake drum, which forces the secondary shoe against the brake drum surface. Different types of shoe brakes are used, viz., single shoe brake, double shoe brake, internal expanding brake, external expanding brake. The brake shown in fig. Brakes with this layout are therefore referred to as two trailing shoe brakes. Brake shoe set Mitsubishi FUSO FE 19872005 Front or Rear.</p>
