<p>With the quality of bouldering shoes for beginners in mind, the best bouldering shoe for beginner from the best brands in the game would have sat at the top spot on our list, but the bold step taken by italian rock climbing gear manufacturer scarpa, in the design of the scarpa arpia makes it our top choice. The scarpa vapor v is a bouldering shoe with medium stiffness, making it a good choice when you are starting to get into harder boulder problems, but aren’t quite ready for the super aggressive shoe required to send harder problems. These shoes have just enough downturn to make them the perfect pair to try out on some aggressive features. The shoe takes a lot of inspiration from the instinct line, with a few extra tricks up its sleeve.</p>
