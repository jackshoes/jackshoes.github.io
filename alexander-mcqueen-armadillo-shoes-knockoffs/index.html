Alexander McQueen ‘Armadillo’ Boots Up For Auction At From footwearnews.com
If there’s one thing designer alexander mcqueen will be remembered for besides his fashion collections, it’s his shoes. The armadillo boots first appeared on the spring/summer 2010 ‘plato’s atlantis’ show and gained instant attention for their unconventional and striking design. With only 21 pairs ever produced, the shoes were never available to the public except a lucky few, including daphne guinness, kelis and lady gaga, who featured the shoes heavily in her “bad romance” music video. Mcqueen’s armadillo boots made their debut at the designer’s ss10 (and final) show and appeared shortly after in lady gaga ’s bad romance video.
