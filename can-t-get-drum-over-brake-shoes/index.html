Sometimes this is not so obvious when trying to force a drum on. Winding this out as far as possible may help to get a badly worn or scored drum over the brake shoes.

<p>You need to slacken off the brake shoes by twiddling the self adjusting mechanism. A brake shoe, placed symmetrically in a drum of 305 mm diameter and pivoted on a fixed fulcrum e, has a lining which makes contact with the drum over an arc as shown in fig. If the parking brake cable has been adjusted in the past to compensate for the worn shoes you will have to back off the adjustment on the cable. You can do this by gently tapping it in.

<p>Although the primary and secondary shoe issue needs to be addressed, it shouldn't affect the overall diameter of the brake shoes. In a worst case scenario you can always disconnect the brake lines, unbolt the wheel cylinders, chisel the heads off the hold down nails, then start shaking the drum until the shoes and hardware come loose piece by piece.

<p>Basically you want there to be just slight dragging between the brakes and drum when you turn it. I'm sure the shoes are installed correctly, and you're right, i've installed brake shoes before without this problem, but this is the first time i've installed emergency brake shoes on a 4 wheel disc vehicle. If this doesn't work then you might not have the shoes centered, look at the wheel cylinder there should be equal on both sides of the wheel cylinder meaning it shouldn't be extending on one side.

<p>You should be able to see the shoes moving closer together. 4.44.when the shoe is operated by the force f, the normal pressure at position θ is p=0.53 sinθ mpa.if the coefficient of friction between the lining and the drum is 0.2 and the width of the lining is 38.

<p>If they are over adjusted, the brakes can lock up, or be activated with very little pressure on the brake pedal. Apply and release the parking brake a few times to center the shoes and then see if the drum will turn. Sometimes, depending on mc design, you can't push the fluid back into the reservoir, and if the brakes were bled with the drum off then the wheel cylinder extended, (filled with fluid) and pushed the shoes outward, so you can't get the drum on. You measure the drum with the micrometer, then you transfer that measurement over to the brake gauge set on drum. Help Stuck on Replacing Rear Emergency Brake Shoes.</p>

<p>If your emergency brake is not adjusted last, you will have a soft / low peddel. Just tap the whole thing with the heel of your clean hand to get it centered and the drum should go on. Drum brakes are more than adequate for street bikes and have teh advantage that in bad weather they dont corrode and seize requiring at least one stripdown per winter, or vary in effectiveness depending whether its wet or dry. Check the brake drum for scoring or other wear. Trouble with rear brake drums (can't get drum back on.</p>

<p>Drum brakes are more than adequate for street bikes and have teh advantage that in bad weather they dont corrode and seize requiring at least one stripdown per winter, or vary in effectiveness depending whether its wet or dry. The manual says to set the gauge on heel and adjust the heel and toe of the shoes. Manually adjusted systems usually have a square adjuster at the back of the assembly. You measure the drum with the micrometer, then you transfer that measurement over to the brake gauge set on drum. How to adjust drum brakes.</p>

<p>For drum brakes, squeeze the two shoes together at the brake cylinder. Check on the left side and you will probably see a lot of room between that shoe and the drum. You have to retract the brake cylinder pistons to get drums/calipers on. You may have a too small diameter drum, or the shoe friction material may be too thick.

<p>Sometimes, depending on mc design, you can't push the fluid back into the reservoir, and if the brakes were bled with the drum off then the wheel cylinder extended, (filled with fluid) and pushed the shoes outward, so you can't get the drum on. Basically you want there to be just slight dragging between the brakes and drum when you turn it. That method is used if the emergency cables are frozen so bad you cant take out the (slack) to get proper adjustment, or the drum over the shoe. The brake drum should now go back on smoothly.

<p>You have to retract the brake cylinder pistons to get drums/calipers on. With any style of brake (drum or rotor), new shoes/pads will always be thicker than the ones you are replacing. If the parking brake cable has been adjusted in the past to compensate for the worn shoes you will have to back off the adjustment on the cable. Attached are many pictures of my situation.

<p>You can do this by gently tapping it in. The gauge also has toe and heel settings. Attached are many pictures of my situation.

<p>You need to slacken off the brake shoes by twiddling the self adjusting mechanism. If they are over adjusted, the brakes can lock up, or be activated with very little pressure on the brake pedal. 2006 focus rear brakes squealing, replaced shoes(old ones not bad), difficulty remounting drum, hammered them on, squealing louder, replaced shoes again(had a ripple damage on trailing shoe) still can. If you do not have a brake lathe there are other ways to do it. Beetle OvalWindow 195357 View.</p>

If you find it hard to get the drum on again, you may need to adjust the clearance adjuster. I know from limited experience that there isn't a lot of clearance of the shoes to inner drum of the disc assembly. A brake shoe, placed symmetrically in a drum of 305 mm diameter and pivoted on a fixed fulcrum e, has a lining which makes contact with the drum over an arc as shown in fig.</p>

You have to retract the brake cylinder pistons to get drums/calipers on. Apply and release the parking brake a few times to center the shoes and then see if the drum will turn.
