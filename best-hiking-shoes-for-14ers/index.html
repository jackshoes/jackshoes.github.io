Best Light Hiking Boots for 2018 Gear Institute From gearinstitute.com

Traditional leather shoes are almost always going to be more durable than the lightweight trail runners on our list. Colorado’s 14ers range in difficulty from class 1 day hikes, meaning you just walk up without using your hands or any special equipment, to class 4 overnight climbs requiring the use of technical gear like ropes and harnesses. Best of all, it felt like a short, straight climb to the top, unlike grays peak, where the final part of the hike included an endless amount of switchbacks covered in small, loose rock.
