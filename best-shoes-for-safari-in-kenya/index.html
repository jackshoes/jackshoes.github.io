Bata Legacy Safari Boot Men &amp; Ladies World of Workwear From worldofworkwear.co.za
By taking sandals and a pair of safari boots or normal african shoes as depends on the type of safari trip you will get the best of both worlds.

Jambo raza, the lake nakuru outing was great! We find that light trail shoes and hybrid shoe/sandals (keen, teva, merrel, north face, hitec, garmont, salomon etc) are adequate for regular travel and normal safari conditions.
