<p>Esd can occur throughout the manufacturing, test, shipping, handling, or operational processes, and during field service The failure threshold voltage and failure signature associated with each esd model and simulator were determined for each test sample. When using esd shoes people with a high foot resistance should use a moisturizing lotion on their feet before they wear shoes, which require a specified conductance to ground during a test. (ics), the high peak voltage and current of these esd strikes can cause catastrophic failures. Comfortable Cleanroom Esd Safety Shoes Buy Light Safety.</p>

<p>While one style of esd shoes may retain its esd properties for 6 months or longer, another will start failing within 90 days. Then, over time, usually the oxide layer will start to degrade and malfunction. Most heel strap testers apply an open circuit voltage between 6 to 12 volts, well below 100 volts for shoes.

Once a component has failed due to an esd event, a sem (scanning electron microscope) will reveal the damage which can be directly attributed to esd. Normal inspection is able to detect a catastrophic failure. If esd protection is not present in a system, the high voltage of an esd strike via an interface connection would cause a large current spike to flow directly into the ic, causing damage.</p>

It can sometimes be the case that footwear which has been labelled as esd capable by the manufacturer then fails the control test carried out by the customer. Latent failures caused by esd can be very costly because repair while an item is in service is far more costly than fixing an item that ahs failed in the factory.
