New weightlifting shoes. Deadlift PR coming soon to an From reddit.com
As far as using olympic lifting shoes for deadlifts goes, i don’t like them and most people probably would do better with a completely flat shoe. A weightlifting shoe’s elevated heel will add more range of motion to our deadlift which can then result in more work output and barbell displacement. The squat and deadlift are outcomes of newton’s 3rd law, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Some people purposely train this way to help them get stronger at their deadlifts, but forzaglia says it should only be done under the guidance of a trainer or a coach.
