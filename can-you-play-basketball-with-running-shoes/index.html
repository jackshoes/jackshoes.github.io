<p>I have found students coming to a lesson in running shoes. If you are a runner used to running in minimalist or light running shoes, choosing a heavy basketball shoe may cause fatigue and make it harder for you to stay in long distance running stride. Another option is taping your ankles to provide extra support as you jump and execute fast stops and starts. If you are a younger and lighter player, additional cushioning is probably not as important, but firm shoes can still lead to sore legs after a day of playing outdoors.</p>
