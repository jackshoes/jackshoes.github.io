There is an old rule that says that you can’t, but rules are meant to be broken and it all depends on how you dress your shoes and pants as part of an outfit. Just as you can pair brown shoes with black pants, you can also wear brown footwear with a black dress. Sometimes i get negative comments about the colour combo from the local “fashionista”, but the reality is that that old rule went out the window several years ago, so i’m not bothered! Black and brown work best together when you skip any bold or bright colors and just do a mix of neutral hues.
