This is an approach shoe a difference.on todays show we take a look at the brand new black diamond sessions.and try to figure out what this shoe is actua. Approach shoes with stiffer midsoles are better for climbing as they can support your weight on small ledges and cracks without folding over, but the lack of cushioning often causes foot fatigue while hiking long miles. An approach shoe uses a lugged sole, which is designed for grip and traction on a variety of surfaces, whereas a climbing shoe uses a sticky rubber sole that offers precision and friction on climbing surfaces. The first is that they are normally shod with the same rubber used on climbing shoes, which is a softer, more sticky compound that gives way more grip on rocky terrain.
