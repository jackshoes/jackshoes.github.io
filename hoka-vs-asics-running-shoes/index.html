<p>The pegasus, now on its 38th version has achieved legendary status because of its consistent ride, high durability and its fair price of $120. Here we will be comparing these two daily trainers. The arahi and gaviota are two stability shoes from hoka that are designed to offset overpronation, but we prefer the hoka arahi over the gaviota for runners because it’s so lightweight. Asics, however, states that its running shoes are built to last between 450 and 550 miles.</p>
