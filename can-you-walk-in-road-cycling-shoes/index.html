Road shoes are much harder to walk in and are significantly stiffer, this would be an unsafe experience. Shoes used for road cycling have a rigid sole and less flexibility than most shoes, allowing for maximal energy transfer and a powerful pedal stroke. If walking in your chosen commuting shoes is not essential, then do check out their mountain bike and road cycling range too. You need to get shoes with the correct drilling (number/position of holes) for the pedal/cleat system you want to use.
