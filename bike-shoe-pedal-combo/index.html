<meta name="description" content="Bike Shoe Pedal Combo, Last year (rba, july 2020), i knew the terrain would be rugged and there would be plenty of walking, so it was an easy decision to run a gravel shoe/ pedal combo. Decathlon was my first thought too, but more for pedals, you&#39;d get set up for both for ~£50 tho.
Combo Sidebike Road Cycling White Shoes &amp; Fusion SPDSL From snapdeal.com
I recently ordered a javelin parma road bike, and was wondering what everyone would suggest as far as a shoe and pedal combo. I am a super aggressive rider, doing mostly all mountain treks in the colorado area. After years of riding platform and 5.10&#39;s i&#39;m looking for suggestions for a good clipless pedal and shoe combo. Clipless shoes allow you to be more powerful with every pedal stroke than a traditional shoe.
