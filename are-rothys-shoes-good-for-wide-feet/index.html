<p>Now, about a year in, my rothy’s are basically a mold of my feet (in a good way!) here’s some a photo of me wearing my pair of rothy’s in la! I'm not sure if they have some inconsistency in their sizes, collected reviews from different models under one shoe type or what, but the reviews were full of everything from too big to too. I normally wear a 6.5 shoe size but due to reviews, decided to go up a size on both shoes. Honestly, they are slightly uncomfortable for wide feet, and sometimes my pinky toe will go numb from being squeezed in there, but i still wear them almost every day.

<p>When my feet get hot in any type of shoe, they are prone to sweat and my feet seem to sweat the exact same amount in my rothy’s that they do in any other type of shoe. I returned them for a 10.5.
