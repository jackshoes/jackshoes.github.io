Now the auction house has announced a pair of waffle spike shoes crafted by nike cofounder, bill bowerman, it will offer bidders from june 17 to june 26. The reason for this is that bill was constantly tinkering and modifying his shoes, and bowerman added the waffles and a strip of white material to the right shoe for mays to test (as discussed in the accompanying letter), which he never got around to. Bowerman received his shoe patent number 3,793,750 on february 26, 1974 and nike began producing the “waffle” trainers the same year. Nike made 12 of the shoes for runners in the 1972 olympic trials, and the design went on to help nike become a global sneaker powerhouse.
