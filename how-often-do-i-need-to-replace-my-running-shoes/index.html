If you ask the big shoe brands how often you should replace your running kicks, they’re going to give you a mileage estimate.
AnneSophie Reinhardt From annesophie.us
My shoe of choice has no cushioning, so there&#39;s really no reason to replace them until the upper falls apart or they get excessive sole wear. As a general rule, you should consider changing your running shoes between every 400 to 500 miles. If you ask the big shoe brands how often you should replace your running kicks, they’re going to give you a mileage estimate. That&#39;s roughly every 300 to 500 miles, which equates to approximately four to six months for someone who runs 20 miles.
