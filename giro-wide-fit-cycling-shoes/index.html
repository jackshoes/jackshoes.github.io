I did the measurements from bont&#39;s website (260 mm length, 110 width) and it suggests 42.5 double wide or custom shoes. Giro understands the importance of ergonomics, aerodynamics and support, and their cycling shoes reflect this. And with an easy to adjust upper and stiff sole unit, they offer excellent comfort and pedalling efficiency in equal measure. Why you need them and which brand makes the best.
