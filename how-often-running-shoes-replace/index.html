How Often Should You Replace Your Running Shoes? HOKA From hokaoneone.com
After a certain amount of use, the integrity of the shoe may be affected and that leads to the real reason to replace running shoes: The bottom or sides are visibly beaten up, the treads are worn out, or the midsole is wrinkling. However, if your running shoes are not showing any of the above signs of excessive wear, you may be able to wear them for longer without increasing the risk of injury.
