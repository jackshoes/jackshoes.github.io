Nike, Betsy Ross and that OldSchool Flag Probably Isn’t From alifenotgrey.com

Kaepernick claims the betsy ross flag is racially insensitive. Laferrara is going in to avoid having to address the actual grievance that caused nike to pull the shoe in the first place. Many call it is a powerful political symbol and deemed by many to represent a time in the united states history or british america as it was.
