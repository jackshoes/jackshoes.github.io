<p>Handheld aerators have longer tines than aerating shoes, and the sharp tines dig down easily into compacted soil and so are more effective. Aerating the lawn will help to improve drainage and will add air into the soil which will improve the conditions for the grass roots to live in. A great example of a hand aerator is a pitch fork or a hollow tine aerator. You can use the fork aerator on smaller lawn areas, especially in places that have more traffic (and therefore ground compaction) than others.</p>
