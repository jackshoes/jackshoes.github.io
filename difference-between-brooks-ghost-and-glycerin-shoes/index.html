Kiwi Running Comparison Brooks Ghost 4 vs Brooks Glycerin 9 From kiwi-running.blogspot.com
If i had to describe the shoes with one word (each), i&#39;d say the brooks glycerin 19 is &#39;plush&#39; while the brooks ghost 14 is &#39;neutral&#39;. Comparing hoka vs brooks running shoes could largely be described as a difference in fit and feel, along with some company philosophy if you care about those things. In terms of lockdown, the brooks ghost 14 is rather loose (with a mesh upper), while the levitate’s fit is tighter (with knit ). The ghost 13 men’s shoes weigh about 10.1 ounces, and the women’s weigh 8.8 ounces.
