What is wrong with Nike running shoes? Quora From quora.com
I’m hoping for 500 miles (804.67km), i’d love to hear everyone’s thought about longevity. In general, look at your shoes lasting roughly about 500 miles, or approximately every four to six months. Swapping out shoes at 400 or 500 miles is probably still a good idea, but don’t swap out an aging shoe because you liked how it felt fresh out of the box—shoot for shoes that feel good on your feet after 100 or 200 miles of running, since this is when a shoe starts to “bottom out” in its cushioning loss. Running shoes for example, tend to last in.
