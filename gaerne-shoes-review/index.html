As we mentioned earlier in this review, videos can be a really informative way of getting to see product reviews without being able to physically get hold of the product.

Coming in at £280 gaerne&#39;s carbon g.stilo road shoes are certainly at the pricey end of the scale, but i would argue that their performance and quality justifies their cost.
