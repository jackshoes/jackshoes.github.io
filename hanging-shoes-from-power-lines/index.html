What Do Shoes Hanging on Power Lines Mean? From reference.com
In the article what do shoes on power lines mean, angie larsen reports that although the event seems like a harmless act of vandalism, the weight of the shoes can cause dangerous conditions. The reason they are hanging, legend has it, is that when the dead person&#39;s spirit returns, it will walk that high above the ground, that much closer to heaven. The hanging shoes say that crack house has crack cocaine that is marketed well. Chicago police normally decline to comment on the matter, but you can get the information from other members of society.
