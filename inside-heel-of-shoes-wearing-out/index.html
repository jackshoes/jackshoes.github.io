Supinators show wear on the outside edges of your heels and on the outsides of the balls of your feet (the side toward the pinky toe). The choice of cloth is important. Excessive pressure on the heel damages the fat pad that cushions the calcaneus. If you find the shoe wears out on the inside below the heel too fast, you are striking the ground too hard while walking or running, putting excessive pressure on your heel.
