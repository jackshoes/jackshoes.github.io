How to Stop a Dog from Chewing Everything in Sight From nylabone.com
With no shoes left around when you are away, and with a reliable leave it command that redirects your pooch to an appropriate chew toy, there is ultimately little margin for error and your pooch will look more and more forward to gnawing on his chew toys rather than your shoe toys; Don’t confuse your dog by giving him anything that may be mistaken for a forbidden object. If your dog follows you throughout the house, only chews on your shoes when you&#39;re not home, acts up when you get ready to leave and welcomes you lavishly when you return, separation anxiety might be brewing. Dogs who are stressed or agitated when left alone are more likely to chew furniture or shoes as a way of relieving anxiety.
