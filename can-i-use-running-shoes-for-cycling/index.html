<p>They're kind of like a hybrid shoe. If clipless pedals are what you’re riding, you’ll require biking shoes with cleats that are designed to click into the pedal mechanism, attaching your shoe to the pedal until released. Tennis shoes are flat, with little to no heel elevation. Hitting a rock or tree branch can rip the fabric which is a waste of your shoe. 2018 New Cycling Shoe Biycle Bike SPD System Self locking.</p>

<p>Yes, you can use them with normal shoes, but as you predict, it isn't very comfortable, especially if your shoes have thin, flexible soles.

<p>What do you think, can ride with them just fine? Cycling shoes are constructed with a rigid sole plate that is ideal for cycling, but not suitable for running (due to this lack of flexibility, we also discourage driving a car in the slipstream). We do not recommend running or high impact cardio in either style. However, when the peloton is delivered it comes with the delta clips only for road cycling.
