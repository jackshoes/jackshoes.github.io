evolv Elektra VTR Rock Shoes Women&#39;s REI Coop Rock From pinterest.com
Essentially the same shoe as the defy, but just made to fit women&#39;s feet and in a girlier colour, it&#39;s a great choice for beginners but also for advanced climbers looking for a comfortable shoe. I purchased the evolv elektra vtr shoes (womens ðŸ™‚ which is also better because i am switching from veggie to vegan currently, so the friendlier the better!) and while i have been climbing for almost 3 months, i can not quite get a grip on exactly how they are supposed to fit. The first thing you&#39;ll notice when you&#39;re packing the elektra to go up to the crag is that these shoes don&#39;t smell. The fit should appeal to both novices and veteran climbers, making them good all around shoes at a very good price.
