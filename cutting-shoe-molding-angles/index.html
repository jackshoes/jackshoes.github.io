Pin on Construction/Woodworking From pinterest.com
Once you&#39;ve cut the shoe molding to size, it&#39;s time to nail them into place. Divide 30 by two to arrive at the miter angle, and cut a couple of scraps at 15 degrees. Yet it wasn&#39;t cohesive to the problems given the age of our home. I ran stained shoe once and kept a little tinted varnish on a rag near my saw.with each end cut i wiped enough finish on the ends to hide most of the end grain.when butting casing, i like to ease the end with a 22 1/2 but will now try a 45.
