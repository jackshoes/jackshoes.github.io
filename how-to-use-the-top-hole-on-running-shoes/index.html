If you are prone to injury on the top of your foot, or if you find tight or high lacing uncomfortable, try using the special heel lock, as it has all the benefits of the regular heel lock or tight normal lacing, but with less pressure on the top of the foot. If you are unable to see a consistent wear pattern by looking at the bottom of the running shoes, place the shoes on a flat surface. These type of adhesives require up to 72 hours of drying and curing before the shoe can be worn again, so you may need to use a backup pair of running shoes. Secure the sole to the shoe while the glue is drying with rubber bands or tape.
