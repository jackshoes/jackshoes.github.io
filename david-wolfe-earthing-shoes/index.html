<p>Some of the health benefits, many people have reported, written about in clint ober’s book, earthing, are: “earthing,” also known as “grounding,” is a pseudoscientific belief that claims electrons continually flow back and forth between the earth and our bodies and cure or alleviate almost every disease or affliction known to man. I think this is solid evidence, but please let me know if you disagree, and you’re very well educated on this subject. What’s truly awesome, is earthing is so needed, there may be a day when being grounded is as common as having a place to sleep.</p>

<p>David wolfe is not the only one that feels a difference from earthing or grounding (that is what it is called). I think this is solid evidence, but please let me know if you disagree, and you’re very well educated on this subject. Studies have shown that maintaining a direct connection between your body and the earth’s surface can be beneficial to your health. David wolfe has tested this with an emf (electromagnetic frequency meter) and found a metal plate or rod grounded into the earth does ground you well and uses it on his grounding or earthing products.

<p>A body voltage meter can determine how much electricity is induced when lying in bed or sitting in a chair, and how much the electric charge is reduced by grounding. Using an earthing mat can help you stay free from absorbing harmful emf waves that are all around you.it will stop the harmful radiation types from interring with your brainwave patterns and keeping stressed out.

<p>Thanks for stopping by my grounding for health website. But that is a good thing, a very good thing for many reasons! I'm a big fan of david wolfe at the moment, and he's done a lot to popularise the concept of earthing as a health benefit. I would also recommend using earthing shoes or esd (electrostatic discharge) grounding shoes. Pin on Kibbe Dramatic.</p>
