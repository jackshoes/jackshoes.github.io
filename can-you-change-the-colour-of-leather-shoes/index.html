When you have completely cleaned the shoes, let them dry for at least 15 minutes, so that the preparer doesn’t prevent the colour dye from absorbing into the leather. As you just subject the shoe to all kinds of chemicals, the first thing is to apply the mink oil renovator to ensure that the leather does not dry up. You can only go from a light colour to a darker colour, unlike painting shoes. It does not have to be made especially for shoes, just for suede in general.

<p>Dyeing patent leather shoes is a fairly easy process. While a company like saphir shoe polish has up to 16 different colors, others will pretty much have the standard brown and black colors of shoe polish. Please understand one very important factor: You can use this process on any leather shoes, boots or handbags (even leather belts) if you want to either rejuvenate or change the colour.

<p>Valmour recommends to proceed in 4 steps : I used to buy leather goods from the thrift store that were gross colours like maroon (no offence to maroon lovers in the audience!), and change the colour to black or silver. Yes, if the shoes are leather. You will be able to switch them only to an even darker color later, so so if you're unsure what hue you want, start off with a light color.

<p>Before you can dye leather boots, you'll need to apply a deglazer to them to remove their protective coating so the dye sticks. What color you end up with depends on how soft the finish of the leather is on the brown boots that you want to change the color on. I've found shoe cremes without a lot of wax tend to work well because they have more pigment than wax and penetrate leather better. Dyeing faux leather shoes can be a very difficult process if you don’t know what you are going to use and what materials you are working with, sometimes the faux leather fabrics in the shoes are not going to absorb the color well and they may even start having a horrible smell which is going to make you feel bad about you shoes never wear them again!

<p>Use color dye tarrago for this type of colour change. For my shoes, i mixed gift box blue with white for this lovely aqua. You need a dye that is specifically made for changing the color on suede products. I have used shoe polish on leather that seems to be sealed since it has a shiny finish, and it didn't really change the color that much, but rather gave a hue/sheen of the new color.
