Dog shoes, boots, and booties can protect your pup from hot pavement. Pull them on over top of a pair of dog socks , and your pup will be warm, protected, and comfortable. If it is your dog’s first time trying on his new shoes, it may be helpful to put the shoes only on the two front paws first. Please note that dogs sweat through their paws.
