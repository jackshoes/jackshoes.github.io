<p>The most important parameter in changing biomechanical loading is the distance between the hip and crank axis (also pedal position on the foot). The change in shock absorption properties of current running shoe models was studied as a function of miles run. Different shoes and strike patterns produce different biomechanical characteristics that can affect injury risk. Aging of running shoes and its effect on mechanical and biomechanical variables: Running / footwear biomechanics Philippe Malcolm, Ph.D..</p>
