Steps to follow for the correct adaptation of the shoe to your foot: Chanel typically run a 1/2 size to a full size small. I don’t want them too baggy so i’m not sure if i should size down, i went one size down (size 2 instead of 4) for the oversized hoodie sweater dress and it fit perfectly, but obviously pants will be a different story. I did also try the size 3, and couldn’t even get my foot into them, so i’d say go with your usual size if you’re buying these.
