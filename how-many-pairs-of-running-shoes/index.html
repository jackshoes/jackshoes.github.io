How much does a pair of running shoes weigh? Explained From runaddiction.in

A more competitive runner, though, is going to want at least two pairs of shoes, and more likely three. If you’re training for a marathon consider having two basic pairs plus the lighter pair. At a minimum, every runner should consider having at least two pairs of their main running shoes that they are actively using at one time and rotate different running shoes between workouts.
