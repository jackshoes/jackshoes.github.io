Designed for high performance and durability, five ten shoes are craved by top athletes in many sports including professional rock climbers and mountain bikers.

<p>Because the shoe is also built on a neutral last, you don’t get that added benefit of ‘hooking’ pockets on steep terrain like you would with the five ten hiangle or other shoe that have an aggressive camber. A mix of leather and mesh adds the durability to keep you. I've always used clipless pedals, but now am getting more into free ride stuff so i switched to flats.

<p>They weigh 41g less than the giro chamber ii, and 81g less than the five ten hellcat pro, both of which are somewhat beefier and more gravity oriented shoes. Like the rest of the niad range, the mocc has a blunt toe, so honing in on those small pockets isn’t exactly where this shoe excels.
