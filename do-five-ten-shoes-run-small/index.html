<p>Because the shoe is also built on a neutral last, you donât get that added benefit of âhookingâ pockets on steep terrain like you would with the five ten hiangle or other shoe that have an aggressive camber. A mix of leather and mesh adds the durability to keep you. I've always used clipless pedals, but now am getting more into free ride stuff so i switched to flats.
